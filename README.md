# Infrastructure

Infrastructure for my papers, talks, repos, etc.

Since I am standing on the shoulder of giants, you may find your code here.

Please feel free to copy all you find relevant.

Folders:

- `latex`: LaTeX infrastructure
- `bibtex`: Bibliography infrastructure

Note: updated frequently.
